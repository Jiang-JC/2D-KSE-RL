$\widehat{e}_{(0,1)}$



Fixed points list have been obtained with the aid of DRL in the JFNK method. For conciseness, we tabulate only the absolute value of the first three complex-valued Fourier coefficients $\widehat\{e\}_1$
$\widehat{e}_1$,

$\widehat{e}_{(1,0)}$ for each point. The absolute value has not been normalised by the spatial dimensions (64×64). Only one decimal place is retained for clarity. †The cases E1-E17 are further listed in table
