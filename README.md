## Fixed points of 2D KSE


<img src="ImageForPresent\FixedPoints.png" width="800">


Four exemplary fixed points in the 2D KSE in (a) phase space and (b) physical spatial domain. In the phase space representation, the figure is characterized by the set $\hat{e}\_(0,1)$, ̂e(1,1), ̂e(1,0) in the Fourier space.
For example, $\widehat{e}_{(0,1)}$ is the first Fourier mode in the y direction with zero Fourier mode in the x direction.

Fixed points list for 2D KSE. For conciseness, we tabulate only the absolute value of the first three complex-valued Fourier coefficients for each point. The absolute value has not been normalised by the spatial dimensions (64×64). Only one decimal place is retained for clarity. †The cases E1-E17 are further listed in table
